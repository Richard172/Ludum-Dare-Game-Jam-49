# Intro
Break Through is a hard 2D platformer game made in Godot game engine with black and white, pixelated art. The game is made for Ludum Dare 49 game compo. The theme for the compo this time is unstable. I incoporated the theme by making some blocks, and the player movement unstable. There are 5 levels in total.
